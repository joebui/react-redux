# Sample React Flux project using Redux

## How to setup and run the project (dev mode)

-   Go to REST and SPA folders to install packages for each

```
$ npm i
```

-   Direct to REST folder to run the RESTful web service

```

## Dockerize the project (production mode)

I have included 2 Dockerfile files in REST and SPA folder so that you can build images and run containers for both. Or you can 
pull the images I created from Docker Hub by following these links
